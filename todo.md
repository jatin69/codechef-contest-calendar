# TODO

- clean code file
- find a way to `insert` events without google authentication everytime. Possibly with a service account.
- cron job work can be done in AWS Lambda and cloudwatch events. It will remain in free tier.
- Make a good readme file to tell users how to add this calendar to their own
- Dont upload credentials and token on github. Please.
- AWS is safe. But be careful.
- ADD A way to stop duplicate event addition. Use custom ID while adding events. Then read events & skip id's.
