## Product

### Google Calendar

The Calendar is publically available [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=N2RxbWZuNm12cmVpcWIyNmpkbjVydWs1amtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). Because it is a Google Calendar, you will need a google account to be able to view it.
You can add the calendar to your calendars by clicking the bottom right link `Add to Calendar` in the calendar view you get from the above link. Once added, it will sync all contests periodically.

### iCal file

You can also download the `ical` file from [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/7dqmfn6mvreiqb26jdn5ruk5jk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) if you want to add all events to your primary calendar. No sync will occur when events are added from `ical` file.


More Details coming soon.
