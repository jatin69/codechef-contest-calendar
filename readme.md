## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Codechef Calendar not showing up Google Calendar App?</summary>
<br>
New Calendars are sometimes hidden by default in the Calendar App. To make it visible, go to `settings` in the calendar app. You'll see a `show more` button under your id. Tap it, select `Codechef Contest Calendar` and turn the `sync` on.
Calendar will now show in your main calendar. If you want to hide it at any point of time, open the side menu and simply unset the checkbox in front of the calendar.

<summary>I accidently added all events from ical file. How do i delete them?</summary>
<br>
There isn't an official way to delete them. However [this post](http://blog.tomverhoeff.nl/2011/01/31/howto-undo-ical-import-in-google-calendar/) might be handy. 
Simply open the `ical` file in a text editor & replace all occurences of `CONFIRMED` with `CANCELLED` & re-import the file. This should delete all the events. Good luck.
